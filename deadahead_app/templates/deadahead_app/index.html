            <h4 class="">What I Do</h4>
            <p>As a product manager I help bring concepts into reality, from their inception to delivery.
                I use my knowledge of the market, the product and the competition to define and prioritize backlog
                items, so the right product is delivered at the right time.
                By analyzing key metrics, like user tracking- and customer feedback data, I take data-centric decisions.
                By running experiments I make sure that business goals are met while providing the best possible user
                experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h4 class="">How I Work</h4>
            <p>Having coded for much of my life, abstracting complex problems into smaller parts comes natural to me.
                That allows me to take a business requirement and dissect it into its components, so that UX/UI,
                Development and Testing teams have all the info they need for execution.
                At the same time, I use my solid background in Human-Computer Interaction to think in a user-centered
                way, balancing business requirements against user needs. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h4 class="">Why I Do It</h4>
            <p>My goal is bringing uncompromisingly delightful experiences to my users.
                I want to go to sleep at night knowing that I've taken no shortcuts in delivering the best possible
                product.
                I want to build products that I can recommend to family and friends with a perfect conscience, because
                I'm convinced it's the best result achievable.
